# Satalytics---A Python software-for-chemical-data-analysis
Satalytics is a software that was developed from me and two other bioinformaticians in the scope of the course Academic Consultancy Training. It is capable of processing chemical data in excel files and producing visual reports in PDF. It's main advantage is that is insanely user friendly and it is created to be used from scientists with no relation to programming. It's interface is simple and yet powerful.

To run it: Install the necessary packages and run the file GUI.py

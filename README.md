# Satalytics---A Python software-for-chemical-data-analysis
Satalytics is a software that was developed from me and two other bioinformaticians in the scope of the course Academic Consultancy Training. It is capable of processing chemical data in excel files and producing visual reports in PDF. Its main advantage is that is insanely user friendly and it is created to be used from scientists with no relation to programming. Its interface is simple and yet powerful.
